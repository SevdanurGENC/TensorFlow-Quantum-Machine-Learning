TensorFlow Quantum Machine Learning
 
TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ) is a Python framework for quantum machine learning. As an application framework, TFQ allows quantum algorithm researchers and ML application researchers to leverage Googleâ€™s quantum computing frameworks, all from within TensorFlow.

TensorFlow Quantum focuses on quantum data and building hybrid quantum-classical models. It provides tools to interleave quantum algorithms and logic designed in Cirq with TensorFlow. A basic understanding of quantum computing is required to effectively use TensorFlow Quantum.
